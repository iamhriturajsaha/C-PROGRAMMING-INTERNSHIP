## 📋 Projects Overview

| Project | Description | Key Features |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 🏦 Banking Management System | Command-line banking application | Account management, transactions, file persistence |
| 🛒 Inventory Management System | Retail inventory tracking system | Stock management, sales processing, reporting |

## 🏦 Banking Management System

**Purpose** - Simulate core banking operations with secure data handling.

**Features** -
- Create and manage customer accounts.
- Process deposits, withdrawals and balance inquiries.
- Binary file storage for data persistence.
- Input validation and transaction security.

**Data Structure** -
```c
struct Account {
    int acc_no;      // Account number
    char name[50];   // Account holder name
    float balance;   // Current balance
};
```

**Sample Usage** -
```
1. Create Account → Enter details → Account created ✅
2. Deposit Money → Enter amount → Balance updated ✅  
3. Check Balance → View account details ✅
```

## 🛒 Inventory Management System

**Purpose** - Track and manage retail inventory with sales processing.

**Features** -
- Add and manage product catalog.
- Real-time stock tracking and updates.
- Process sales with automatic stock adjustment.
- Comprehensive inventory reporting.

**Data Structure** -
```c
struct Item {
    int id;          // Item ID
    char name[50];   // Product name
    float price;     // Unit price
    int quantity;    // Stock quantity
};
```

**Sample Usage** -
```
1. Add Item → Enter product details → Item added ✅
2. Process Sale → Enter quantity → Stock updated ✅
3. View Inventory → Display all items with stock levels ✅
```
